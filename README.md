üöÄ Tesla Stock & News SMS Notifier üìà
This Python project fetches the latest news and financial data about Tesla using the News API and Alpha Vantage API, respectively. It sends updates via SMS using the Twilio API whenever significant changes in Tesla's stock price occur.


‚ú® Features

üì∞ Retrieves Tesla-related news headlines and descriptions from News API.
üíπ Fetches daily stock price data for Tesla (TSLA) from Alpha Vantage API.
üìä Compares stock price changes between consecutive days and calculates percentage change.
‚úâÔ∏è Sends customized SMS notifications with stock updates and relevant news articles using Twilio.


üìÇ Project Structure

call_apinews(): üì∞ Fetches Tesla-related news from News API.
call_teslas(): üíπ Retrieves Tesla's stock price data from Alpha Vantage API.
send_messages(): ‚úâÔ∏è Sends SMS notifications via Twilio API combining stock data and news.


üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

üêç Python 3.7 or higher


üîë Active accounts and API keys for:

Twilio API
News API
Alpha Vantage API


üîí Environment Variables

This project makes use of environment variables to securely store sensitive information such as API keys and authentication credentials. Using environment variables ensures security and allows for easy configuration across environments.

Required Variables:

ACCOUNT_SID: Twilio Account SID
AUTH_TOKEN: Twilio Auth Token
(Optional) Other secrets, if needed for future extensions.
Example .env File:
Create a file named .env in the root directory and add the following lines:

env
Copiar c√≥digo
ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
How Environment Variables Are Used:
In the code, environment variables are accessed using the os module:

python
Copiar c√≥digo
import os

account_sid = os.getenv("ACCOUNT_SID")
auth_token = os.getenv("AUTH_TOKEN")
This approach ensures sensitive information is not hard-coded into the source files.

üí° Note: If you're unfamiliar with environment variables, don't worry‚Äîthis project helped me learn how to create and use them securely. It's an essential skill in programming that I'm continuing to develop!

üì¶ Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copiar c√≥digo
git clone https://github.com/Ronaldwm89/Tesla-Stock-News-AlertBOT
cd tesla-stock-news-sms
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copiar c√≥digo
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copiar c√≥digo
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your environment variables in a .env file as described above.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
Run the script to fetch Tesla updates and send SMS notifications:

bash
Copiar c√≥digo
python script_name.py

üìù Learning Note
While building this project, I learned how to securely manage sensitive data using environment variables and integrate multiple APIs. This is part of my ongoing journey to improve my Python skills and create more robust applications.

## Environment Variables
This project makes use of **environment variables** to securely store sensitive information such as API keys and authentication credentials. Using environment variables ensures security and allows for easy configuration across environments.

### Required Variables:
- `ACCOUNT_SID`: Twilio Account SID
- `AUTH_TOKEN`: Twilio Auth Token
- (Optional) Other secrets, if needed for future extensions.

### Example `.env` File:
Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add the following lines:
```env
ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
```

### How Environment Variables Are Used:
In the code, environment variables are accessed using the `os` module:
```python
import os

account_sid = os.getenv("ACCOUNT_SID")
auth_token = os.getenv("AUTH_TOKEN")
```
This approach ensures sensitive information is not hard-coded into the source files.
